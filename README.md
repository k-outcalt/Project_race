# Project_race
 Python race project

About this project
------------------
This project was from my first programming class, and we finished off the term simulating a "frog" race amonst different objects. The avatars, also called "frogs" for the project, were instances of a Frog class that could move the frogs and record their coordinates. When the race simulation starts, it runs until a frog crosses the finish line. The movements, besides correcting course, are randomly generated. 

Details
-------
The project is all one .py file consisting of the Frog class, its methods, and functions to simulate the race. The movements that were randomly chosen included changing direction, jumping to a new set of coordinates, or doing nothing. The course and their movements are displayed on the imported turtle application on the console.

How to run the project
----------------------
* If you have an IDE like IDLE, PyCharm, etc. then download race_project.py and run the file from there
* Or, download the .py file and open the terminal 
* Change directories until the folder that has the file is reached 
 * Type `cd "folder_name"` and press enter
* Type `Python race_project.py` and press enter! The turtle application should open up on the screen and the race should start automatically
