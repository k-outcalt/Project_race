# Project_race
 Python race project

About this project
------------------
This project was from my first programming class, and we finished off the term simulating a "frog" race amonst different objects. The avatars, also called "frogs" for the project, were instances of a Frog class that could move the frogs and record their coordinates. When the race simulation starts, it runs until a frog crosses the finish line. The movements, besides correcting course, are randomly generated. 

Details
-------
The project is all one .py file consisting of the Frog class, its methods, and functions to simulate the race. The movements that were randomly chosen included changing direction, jumping to a new set of coordinates, or doing nothing. The course and their movements are displayed on the imported turtle application on the console.
